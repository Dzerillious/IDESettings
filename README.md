# Visual studio settings

You can increase productivity by setting visual studio to be more simple -> faster functionality finding.
Usefull New Git user experience

## Usefull extensions
* ReShaper - Unit tests, refactoring, editing, competion, etc.
* ColorPicker - for simplifying view creation
* Keyboard shortcuts - for comining Rider and VS shortcuts

## Menu bar

Is usefull to hide some bars to reduce noise and make view more accessible and more simple.

### Used
* File - basic stuff
* View - for setting window visibility (can be shown with search all)
* Debug - for additional debug options
* Analyse - possible to remove
* Git - for easier access
* Tools - all installed tools
* ReShaper - reshaper functionality
* Window - splitting, workspace
### Not needed 
* Project - (found in solution explorer)
* Extensions - (move into tools)
* Build - (shortcuts and search all)
* Help - (found in the internet)

## Toolbars

My advice is to hide all toolbars, it's better to use the functionality from shortcuts.

## Most important shortcuts to learn
* Window.QuickLaunch (my Ctrl+Shift+P as VS Code)
* Reshaper_GoToType (my Ctrl+N)
* Reshaper_GoToFile (my Ctrl+Shift+N)
* Refactor (my Ctrls + Shift + R)
* Window.Close (my Shift+Esc)
* Window.ActivateDocumentWindow (my Esc)
